	  <h1>How to Use the ClozeFox Language Test Plug-in for Firefox</h1>

	  <p>
	    You are trying to learn a foreign language or teach one,
	    e.g. English.  You would like to have fill in the blanks
	    tests (cloze tests) with authentic and original material
	    (such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, blog
	    entries, etc.). You'd like to keep your scores, details
	    about them and share them if you like. Now you can have
	    these without leaving the comfort of your favorite web
	    browser, Mozilla Firefox. ClozeFox plug in turns your daily
	    browsing experience into a simple social language learning
	    tool.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Usage is very simple. Once you install ClozeFox, visit a
	    web page,
	    e.g. <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Schubert"
	    target=_blank>Franz Schubert on Wikipedia</a> (or <b>right
	    click</b>, go to the ClozeFox menu group on your context
	    menu and choose "<b>Suggest a Page</b>"). Right click with
	    your mouse on the page and in the context menu that
	    appears you'll see the ClozeFox menu group, select it and
	    then select a test strategy, e.g. Preposition Test or
	    Random Test:

	    <p>

	      title="clozefox_calculate_score by Emre Sevinç, on
	      Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4020/4305525325_94e90356ed.jpg"
	      width="478" height="500" alt="clozefox_calculate_score"
	      /></a>
	    </p>

	    <p>You'll immediately see that the page you are looking at
	    is now converted to a language test. Test your knowledge
	    for English prepositions or just do a random test, and
	    then once you are done again right click and in the
	    ClozeFox menu, select "<b>Calculate Score</b>". In this
	    version the system will automatically try to post your
	    results to your Twitter account and thus it is going to
	    ask you your Twitter username and password:</p>

	      alt="clozefox_twitter_user_pass" /></a>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      However you don't have to do this if you don't want it
	      or if you don't have a Twitter account yet. In that case
	      simply click on the Cancel button and no information is
	      going to be posted. But if you choose to post then you,
	      your friends and maybe your teachers can share / see latest results:

	    </p>

	    <p>
	      After your score is calculated, on the main page your
	      correct answers are marked with blue whereas your wrong
	      answers are marked with red:
	    </p>

	      title="clozefox_show_feedback by Emre Sevinç, on
	      Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4306269306_624371d93b.jpg"
	      width="500" height="299" alt="clozefox_show_feedback"
	      /></a>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      If you want to see your previous scores and get some
	      statistics about them all you have to do is to open the
	      slide bar by clickin on the blue right arrow on the
	      upper left corner of the page:
	    </p>
	      
	    <p>

	      width="500" height="390" alt="clozefox_slidebar" /></a>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      What if you want to share this test with your friends or
	      your students? ClozeFox lets you copy the current test
	      configuration to your clipboard with a single menu item
	      click. Once you have it copied to your clipboard you can
	      paste it to your e-mail message or post to a forum and
	      share it with anybody in the world:
	    </p>

	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      That means when your students / friends visit the web
	      address (URL) you sent they will see the test
	      immediately without needing to right click and select
	      some tests:
	    </p>

	      alt="clozefox_clipboard_paste_new_url" /></a>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      And if you want to delete your previous scores you can
	      choose "<b>Delete Score Details</b>" from the menu. The
	      system will warn you about this action because there's
	      no UNDO operation for this. If you think deleting
	      previous scores is a bad idea simply click on the Cancel
	      and nothing will be deleted:
	    </p>

	      width="796" height="295" alt="clozefox_delete_scores"
	      /></a>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Whenever you need help again you can simply select the "<b>Help</b>" menu item from the
	      context menu of ClozeFox.
	    </p>

	    That's all. For now! ;-)
