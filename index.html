	  <h1>ClozeFox Language Test Plug-in for Firefox</h1>

	  <p>
	    You are trying to learn a foreign language or teach one,
	    e.g. English.  You would like to have fill in the blanks
	    tests (cloze tests) with authentic and original material
	    (such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, blog
	    entries, etc.). You'd like to keep your scores, details
	    about them and share them if you like. Now you can have
	    these without leaving the comfort of your favorite web
	    browser, Mozilla Firefox. ClozeFox plug in turns your daily
	    browsing experience into a simple social language learning
	    tool.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Installation is very simple: just click on the Install
	    button on the top right corner of the page and the ClozeFox
	    plug in is going to be installed easily.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Usage is simple too. Once you install ClozeFox, visit a
	    web page,
	    e.g. <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Schubert">Franz
	    Schubert on Wikipedia</a> (or right click, go to the
	    ClozeFox menu group on your context menu and choos
	    'Suggest a Page'). Right click with your mouse on the page
	    and in the context menu that appears you'll see the
	    ClozeFox menu group, select it and then select a test
	    strategy, e.g. Preposition Test. You'll immediately see
	    that the page you are looking at is now converted to a
	    language test. Test your knowledge for English
	    prepositions and then once you are done again right click
	    and in the ClozeFox menu, select "Calculate Score". A
	    small notification will pop up at the bottom right corner
	    of your screen and your score will be saved. If you want
	    to see your previous scores and the pages just click on
	    the Slide Bar and click on the ClozeFox icon to see a
	    list.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    That's all. For now! ;-)
